//we've created a new class here, we've created a base class
//the whole idea of class based languages is that you can take these classes and use them as blue prints for other classes, other object so these things are extendable 

//STATIC METHODS --> new keyword static that allows us to create methods that are static
//when you have a class you have to ubstatntiate a new instance of that class in order to use a method
//sometimes you want to just get some data, access the class and get some information
