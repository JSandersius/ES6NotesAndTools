//we've created a new class here, we've created a base class
//the whole idea of class based languages is that you can take these classes and use them as blue prints for other classes, other object so these things are extendable 

//STATIC METHODS --> new keyword static that allows us to create methods that are static
//when you have a class you have to ubstatntiate a new instance of that class in order to use a method
//sometimes you want to just get some data, access the class and get some information 

//another great thing about Static is that we can use the get and set keyword from objects 
//instead of calling the function, you can create a method 
//when you call it like such as this 
//console.log(Human.SayHello)  it will always return whatever is in there 
//insteasd of having to call it ,you could set it up to do some other things and then return it for you 

//get and set are not ES6 but they are something to think about 

//Kyle Simpson - the class keyword is kind of codifying the constructor pattern 
// The constructor pattern being where we create a function plane and then we use the  new keyword
//Then new keyword for that function is a consttructor function we are constructing in 
//now in classes we have the constructor function, we have this stuff that satisfies this stuff 
// JS is so flexible that one does not need to do these things, but you can
